# Module 4: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Model Context Protocol (MCP). This module covers the emerging standard for AI agent communication and interoperability.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an emerging standard that defines how AI agents, tools, and models communicate and share context. Often called "the USB for AI Agents," MCP enables seamless interoperability between different AI systems.

## Why MCP Matters

### The Interoperability Challenge

- Different AI systems use incompatible interfaces
- Context and memory don't transfer between agents
- Tools and integrations are platform-specific
- Scaling multi-agent systems is complex

### MCP Solutions

- **Standardized Communication**: Universal protocols for agent interaction
- **Context Preservation**: Consistent memory and state management
- **Tool Sharing**: Reusable tools across different systems
- **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation for complex agent ecosystems
