# Module 3: Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Large Language Models (LLMs). This module covers the fundamental concepts, architecture, training, and deployment of modern language models.

## What are Large Language Models?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models use deep learning architectures, primarily transformers, to process and generate text with remarkable sophistication.

## Module Overview
