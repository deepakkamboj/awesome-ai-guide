# Module 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This module covers everything from fundamental concepts to advanced production deployment strategies.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information from external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents and use them to generate more accurate, contextual responses.

## Why RAG Matters

### Solving Key LLM Limitations

**Knowledge Cutoff**: LLMs are trained on data up to a specific date and cannot access newer information.

- **RAG Solution**: Retrieves current information from updated knowledge bases

**Hallucinations**: LLMs sometimes generate plausible but false information.

- **RAG Solution**: Grounds responses in actual retrieved documents

**Domain Specificity**: General LLMs may lack deep domain expertise.

- **RAG Solution**: Integrates specialized knowledge sources

**Context Length**: LLMs have limited context windows for processing information.

- **RAG Solution**: Retrieves only relevant information, optimizing context usage
