    "#### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Reason**: Agent thinks about the problem and plans next action\n",
    "2. **Act**: Agent executes the planned action using tools\n",
    "3. **Observe**: Agent observes the results\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Cycle continues until goal is achieved\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "- **Thought**: Internal reasoning step\n",
    "- **Action**: Tool/function call\n",
    "- **Observation**: Result from action\n",
    "- **Reflection**: Learning from outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Flow:\n",
    "```json\n",

      "\n",
      "#### **Thought 1: Check the Weather Forecast**\n",
      "- **Action:** Look up a reliable weather app (e.g., BBC Weather, Met Office, or AccuWeather) for London‚Äôs hourly/daily forecast.\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** London‚Äôs weather is notoriously unpredictable, but modern forecasts are reasonably accurate for short-term predictions (especially within 6‚Äì12 hours). If rain is >50% likely, bring an umbrella.\n",
      "- **Considerations:**\n",
      "  - Forecasts can be wrong, especially for sudden showers.\n",
      "  - Some apps overpredict rain (e.g., showing 30% chance when it‚Äôs actually dry).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Thought 2: Observe Current Conditions + Cloud Patterns**\n",
      "- **Action:** Step outside (or look out a window) and assess:\n",
      "  - Are the skies overcast or dark?\n",
      "  - Is there a breeze (which might indicate an incoming front)?\n",
      "  - Are there cumulus clouds (possible showers) or stratus clouds (drizzle)?\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** London‚Äôs rain often comes from Atlantic fronts or localized showers. Thick, low clouds or a sudden temperature drop can signal imminent rain.\n",
      "- **Considerations:**\n",
      "  - Requires some basic meteorological intuition.\n",
      "  - May not account for rain later in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Thought 3: Use a Rule of Thumb for London**\n",
      "- **Action:** Assume a **30‚Äì40% baseline chance of rain** in London on any given day (higher in autumn/winter) and carry a compact umbrella regardless.\n",
      "- **Reasoning:**\n",
      "  - London averages **10‚Äì15 rainy days per month**, so the probability isn‚Äôt negligible.\n",
      "  - Umbrellas are lightweight, and being caught without one is more inconvenient than carrying one unnecessarily.\n",
      "- **Considerations:**\n",
      "  - Over-preparation if the day is clearly sunny (wastes effort).\n",
      "  - Doesn‚Äôt account for extreme weather (e.g., heatwaves or storms).\n",

      "### **3. Best Thought & Why: *Check the Weather Forecast* (Score: 7/10)**\n",
      "**Why it wins:**\n",
      "1. **Highest Accuracy:** Modern weather models (especially UK Met Office) are reliable for short-term forecasts. A 60%+ chance of rain is a strong signal.\n",
      "2. **Low Effort, High Reward:** Takes <1 minute to check an app, with minimal cognitive load.\n",
      "3. **Adaptable:** You can recheck later if plans change (e.g., evening outings).\n",
      "4. **Balances Over/Under-Preparation:** Unlike the rule of thumb (which may lead to unnecessary umbrella-carrying), this method is data-driven.\n",
      "\n",
      "**When to override it:**\n",
      "- If the forecast is **<30% rain** but you see **dark clouds moving fast**, combine with **Thought 2 (observation)**.\n",
      "- If you‚Äôre **out all day**, pack a compact umbrella even if the forecast is <50% (London‚Äôs microclimates can surprise).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pro Tip:**\n",
      "- Use **BBC Weather** or **Met Office** (more accurate for UK than global apps like Weather.com).\n",
      "- Look for **\"precipitation probability\"** (not just rain symbols) and **hourly breakdowns**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "### **Final Verdict:**\n",
      "‚úÖ **Yes, carry an umbrella if the forecast shows ‚â•50% rain today.** Otherwise, assess clouds if you‚Äôre out for long. A small, foldable umbrella is a low-cost hedge against London‚Äôs mood swings.\n"
